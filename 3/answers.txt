● How would an automated deployment of this setup look like?

We can define these steps for shipping code from a development environment to staging/production environment:

These are the steps we can consider in Gitlab ci as an example:

stages:
  - build-image
  - test-image
  - publish-image  ---> to a private registry
  - deploy
  - post-deploy

I've defined the Gitlab ci of the nginx as an example.

● How would you backup the single components of this infrastructure?

Using Cron as a scheduling daemon that executes tasks at specified intervals ( For example backup DB or K8s manifest files or etcd and store in the backup storage node.


---------------------------

● What would a rollback of a previous state of the setup look like?

There are various actions we can consider.

For example in K8s env, we could go back to the previous instance of the deployment if there is some issue with the current deployment.

Generally for production use, the best approach is to have a testing environment where you can test any changes before applying them into production. Having this as a VM of course helps with snapshots and rollbacks.

Another approach is the use of modern file systems like ZFS that also allow to do snapshots or even LVM.

● How would you tackle the scaling of your solution?

In K8s, we can use the concept of HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) and VPA (Vertical Pod Scaler) 


---------------------------

● How would you monitor the setup?

I would monitor the setup using Prometheus as a data aggregator, Grafana for Visualization and Alert manager to notify different alerts, specially the critical ones.
